    <h1>Superclasses and Subclasses in Java</h1>
    <p>In Java, superclasses and subclasses are central concepts in object-oriented programming that facilitate inheritance and code reuse.</p>

    <h2>Superclass (Parent Class)</h2>
    <p>A superclass, also known as a parent class or base class, is a class that is extended by another class. It contains common attributes and methods that are shared among its subclasses.</p>

    <h3>Characteristics:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Attributes and Methods:</strong> A superclass can have fields (attributes) and methods that are inherited by its subclasses.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Modifiers:</strong> Methods and fields in the superclass can be <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, or <code>private</code>. Only public and protected members are accessible to subclasses; private members are not directly accessible.</li>
        <li><strong>Constructors:</strong> Superclass constructors are not inherited but can be called from the subclass using the <code>super</code> keyword.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subclass (Child Class)</h2>
    <p>A subclass, also known as a child class or derived class, extends a superclass and inherits its fields and methods. It can also have additional attributes and methods or override methods from the superclass.</p>

    <h3>Characteristics:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> A subclass inherits all non-private fields and methods from its superclass.</li>
        <li><strong>Method Overriding:</strong> A subclass can override methods from the superclass to provide a specific implementation.</li>
        <li><strong>Access to Superclass Members:</strong> A subclass can access public and protected members of the superclass. It cannot access private members directly but can use public or protected methods of the superclass to interact with those members.</li>
        <li><strong><code>super</code> Keyword:</strong> The <code>super</code> keyword is used to refer to superclass members (fields and methods) and to invoke the superclass constructor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example Code</h2>
    <p>The following example illustrates the use of superclasses, subclasses, and the <code>super</code> keyword.</p>
    
    <pre><code>// Superclass
class Animal {
    // Fields
    private String name;
    protected int age;

    // Constructor
    public Animal(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Method
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
    }

    // Getter for name (private field)
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

// Subclass
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Additional field
    private String breed;

    // Constructor
    public Dog(String name, int age, String breed) {
        super(name, age); // Call superclass constructor
        this.breed = breed;
    }

    // Method specific to Dog
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println(getName() + " is barking.");
    }

    // Overriding the eat method
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println(getName() + " the dog is eating.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of Dog
        Dog myDog = new Dog("Rover", 5, "Labrador");

        // Call the methods
        myDog.eat();   // Output: Rover the dog is eating.
        myDog.bark();  // Output: Rover is barking.
    }
}
</code></pre>

    <div class="output">Output:<br>
        Rover the dog is eating.<br>
        Rover is barking.
    </div>
